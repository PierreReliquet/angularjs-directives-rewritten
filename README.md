## angularjs-directives-rewritten

During an AngularJS training session, the trainees were progressing very fast and so I decided to make them code a simplified ngRepeat called znkRepeat to show them that AngularJS is not magic. `It is just amazingly well coded`.

With that repository, I come back on that idea and I reimplement some directives of the Angular core to have a better understanding of how it does work under the hood. 

I also tried to comment the directives to ease the readability because AngularJS' sources are sometimes not so easy to read.

If you like the idea and want to implement some other core directives feel free to submit a pull-request.
